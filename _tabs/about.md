## You are HOU!

Just trying to get ready for 2023 elections in Houston, Harris County, TX. I'll share what I learn here, and maybe touch on other related things too. My goal here is to coagulate some info, support some local civic action, and... gun to my head? Help develop a civic identity and pride in our little county. After all... *We are HOU!*

## HOU else?

I look up to these folks not just because of their content, but also their consistent civic commitment on top of regular life:
