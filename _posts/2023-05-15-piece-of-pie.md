One day when we've lost our way five years from now, we'll  scroll and scroll and scroll just to get back here, just see how we started. Help us see HOU we've become.

Wow, really setting the tone here. Okay, how about this... Let's just say for now the purpose of this project is to: (1) write civics, and (2) get ready for the November 2023 elections in Houston and Harris County. Texas too if there's time, but 2023 is as local as can be! It's not a presidential year. Not even a congressional midterm year. Yes, fewer voters *but:*

**Our vote means more than it will in 2024. And in 2023 we won't have to speak as loudly.** 

I guess that's my pitch for us to care!

Piece of pie!
