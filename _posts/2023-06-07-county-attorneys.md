## Two County Attorneys?

District Attorney and regular County Attorney. What‚Äôs the difference? Both elected positions draw their power from the same paragraph in The Texas Constitution. One is a criminal attorney, representing the state in criminal district courts. The other is a civil attorney, representing the state in civil courts. Smaller Texas counties just have a singular county attorney who performs both duties.[^1]

_*Two* of these three gorgeous devils serve as Harris County's District Attorney and County Attorney_

### Harris County District Attorney (Criminal)

Chief criminal lawyer. People elected to this office serve four-year terms and represent the state in all criminal cases (and habeas corpus cases regardless of criminal or civil court).[^2]

Kim Ogg serves her second term as *Harris County District Attorney*. Ogg was re-elected in November 2020.[^5]

For an inside take on DA Ogg's administration, from someone who works at the Harris County Criminal Justice Center, enjoy <a href="https://harriscountycriminaljustice.blogspot.com/2019/11/the-implosion-of-kim-ogg.html" target="_blank">this 100% unbiased piece titled *The Implosion of Kim Ogg*</a> :P

### Harris County Attorney (Civil)

Chief civil lawyer. Also serving four years, people elected to this position represent the state in all civil cases, and represent the Harris County Flood Control District, while also providing advice to county officials and employees (like a corporate in-house HR counsel for the county).[^3]

Christian Menefee serves his first term as Harris County Attorney. Menefee was elected in November 2020.[^4]

## November 2023 Elections
