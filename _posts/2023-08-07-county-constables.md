## Publicly-Elected Police

We elect judges. Why not cops? We have eight "justice" precincts in Harris County. And each one of those precincts has a Constable. Constables serve four-year terms and "execute process" (i.e. round 'em up, subpoena, writs, sieze property) in county criminal and civil matters. They can also e.p. all over the state for criminal matters.[^1]

There definitely seems to be an overlap of duties with the Harris County Sheriff's office (and possibly Houston Police Department). But while the county sheriff is associated with county jail, the county constables are associated with the justice of the peace courts (we'll explore JoP courts in another post).

### Digital Presence

It looks like some of the eight Harris County Constables have their own .com websites, with their own domain. Public offices usually have websites ending in .gov. And are usually nested together (as in the case of each of the five Harris County Commissioners having their own websites, as a sub-page of an overarching Harris County government site).

## Harris County Constables (Precincts 1-8)
