## Where we're at

There are quite a few elected positions in Harris County[^1] and City of Houston governments. Not all are up for election or re-election in 2023, but the aim here is to at least lightly explore all elected positions. And call out the ones to watch for in November.

### To-do

* County District Clerk
* County Treasurer
* County Tax Assessor-Collector
* County Constables (Precincts 1-8)
* County Civil Courts at Law
* County Criminal Courts at Law
* State 1st Court of Appeals
* State 14th Court of Appeals
* County District Civil Courts
* County District Criminal Courts
* County District Family Courts
* County District Juvenile Courts
* County Justice of the Peace Courts
* County Probate Courts

It typically seems like our ballots are rife with judicial races, regardless of if it's a presidential year or a midterm or neither. And even looking at the list above, our courts system seems confusing. Luckily the <em>Harris County Law Library</em> has a handy infographic onsite:

### Done

Earlier this summer, the following elected positions were explored on this site:

* <a href="https://youarehou.github.io/posts/hisd/" target="_self">Houston Independent School District (HISD) Board of Trustees</a> â€” Districts 2, 3, 4, and 8 have races in November, even though HISD has been taken over by the Texas Education Agency (TEA)
* <a href="https://youarehou.github.io/posts/county-commissioners-court/" target="_self">County Commissioners Court (Judge, Precincts 1-4)</a> â€” No races in November
* <a href="https://youarehou.github.io/posts/county-clerk/" target="_self">County Clerk</a> â€” No race in November
* <a href="https://youarehou.github.io/posts/county-attorneys/" target="_self">County District Attorney</a> â€” No race in November
* <a href="https://youarehou.github.io/posts/county-attorneys/" target="_self">County Attorney</a> â€” No race in November
* <a href="https://youarehou.github.io/posts/county-sheriff/" target="_self">County Sheriff</a> â€” No race in November

## 70 days until voter registration cutoff

If you're not registered to vote by October 10, then you won't be allowed to vote on November 7. Luckily, we have several options for registration and renewal!
