## Sheriff? Hardly even *know* if...

County sheriffs serve four-year terms pretty much in line with what children imagine a sheriff does. *The Texas Constitution*[^1] and *Local Government Code*[^2][^3] outline a few other duties for this elected office as well:
* Appointing active and reserve deputies
* Appointing county police force (in counties with >210,000 people) for locations in the county outside of the county seat (ex: places outside of Houston that are still in Harris County)
* Hire emergency guards for county prison 
* "Execute process" (i.e. round 'em up, subpoena, writs, sieze property) as instructed by county courts, Texas House Speaker, Texas Senate President, or committee chair of Texas Legislature
* Serving as "keeper" and "administrator" of county jails
* There seems to be a good bit about the county sheriff having "exclusive" control of the jail commissary (restaurant) contracting and finances — unless the county has 1+ million people, is next to a county with 1+ million people, or contains two cities with 200,000+ people each.

### Harris County Sheriff[^4]

Harris County Sheriff oversees 4,600 employees, Harris County Jail, and 1,800 square miles (including 41 cities and unincorporated Harris County) outside of Houston.
