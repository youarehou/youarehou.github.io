## Updates

### June 2, 2023, 10:30p
The State of Texas has officially taken over the local Houston Independent School District, appointing a new superintendent for the district, as well as a state-appointed Board of Managers whose authority now supersedes the locally elected HISD Board of Trustees.[^6]

### HISD Board of Trustees

_These gorgeous devils set policy for the Houston Independent School District (HISD)_

The HISD Board is a locally elected body of nine trustees who set policy for the state's largest school district. Trustees currently serve in staggered four-year terms[^1]:
* Elizabeth Santos serves her second term as *District I Trustee*. Santos was re-elected in a December 2021 runoff.
* Kathy Blueford-Daniels serves her first term as Assistant Secretary and *District II Trustee*. Bluford-Daniels was elected in a December 2019 runoff.
* Dani Hernandez serves her first term as President and *District III Trustee*. Hernandez was elected in November 2019.
* Dr. Patricia K. Allen serves her first term as *District IV Trustee*. Dr. Allen was elected in a December 2019 runoff.
* Sue Deigaard serves her second term as *District V Trustee*. Diegaard was re-elected in a December 2021 runoff.
* Kendall Baker serves his first term as Secretary and *District VI Trustee*. Baker was elected in a December 2021 runoff.
* Bridget Wade serves her first term as Second Vice President and *District VII Trustee*. Wade was elected in a December 2021 runoff.
* Judith Cruz serves her first term as *District VIII Trustee*. Cruz was elected in November 2019.
* Myrna Guidry, Esq. serves her first term as First Vice President and *District IX Trustee*. Guidry was elected in November 2021.

### November 2023 Elections

Houstonians will still elect people to HISD board positions in an advisory capacity, to assist the TEA and represent their respective districts in a diminished capacity.[^5]:
* **District II - Kathy Bluford-Daniels** up for re-election to 2nd term, representing parts of North Houston in the Fifth Ward and Kashmere Gardens area
* **District III - Dani Hernandez** up for re-election to 2nd term, representing southeast Houston
* **District IV - Dr. Patricia Allen** up for re-election to 2nd term, representing Third Ward, Midtown, and other neighborhoods in the lower inner loop
* **District VIII - Judith Cruz** up for re-election to 2nd term, representing downtown and East End

If you live in any of the golden areas, you'll be picking a Trustee for HISD at the ballot box in November. But don't worry, your sample ballot from HarrisVotes.org will tell you too:

_Gold-colored districts will elect (or re-elect) their Trustee to the HISD Board in November 2023_

We'll learn more about these races, but with tomorrow's state takeover of the school district, and the election filing deadline three months away, that's it for now!
