## County Treasurer

The office of county treasurer originates in Article XVI of the state constitution. In each of Texas' 254 counties, county treasurers are elected to serve four-year terms.[^1][^2]

Dr. Carla L. Wyatt serves her first term as *Harris County Treasurer*. Dr. Wyatt was elected in November 2022.[^3]
